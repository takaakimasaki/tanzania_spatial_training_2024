# Training Program on Big Data and Geospatial Analysis in Agriculture and Environment

Welcome to the training program on the applications of big data and geospatial analysis in agriculture and environment. This program is designed to enhance the capacity of trainees in leveraging non-traditional data sources like big data or satellite imagery to complement official statistics in agriculture and environment.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this training program are:
- To introduce participants to the concepts of big data, geographic information systems (GIS), and R programming.
- To provide advanced training in GIS, focusing on topics relevant to agriculture and environment.
- To familiarize participants with geospatial data related to environment and agriculture.
- To teach participants methods for integrating survey data with geospatial data.
- To guide participants in formulating a group study proposal utilizing the skills learned.
- To introduce participants to tools like GitHub and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for collaborative work and analysis.
- To provide an opportunity for participants to present their group study proposals.
